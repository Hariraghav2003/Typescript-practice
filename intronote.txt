Typescript: 
        TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which allows for adding more features like OOPS,Strong Typing...etc to the JavaScript making the code 
error free since the JavaScript is loosely typed programming langugage to make it strong we use TypeScript but all the typescript code are transpile (converted)
into JavaScript.
